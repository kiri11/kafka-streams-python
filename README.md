# kafka-streams-python
KafkaStreams library in Python.

Reasons for such a library outlined in 
[this great article](https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-kafka-streams-stream-processing-made-simple/).
However, it's only implemented in Java and there is [no plans](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/38)
to support other languages by Confluence. This is an opportunity for the community to step up and provide a solution.
